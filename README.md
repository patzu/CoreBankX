# CoreBankX

## Introduction

Welcome to the CoreBankX project repository!

### Overview

The CoreBankX project is a sample core banking application designed to provide a hands-on learning experience in developing robust and feature-rich applications using Spring Boot. This project aims to incorporate various tools, technologies, and best practices commonly used in enterprise-level Java development, making it an ideal practice ground for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of CoreBankX is to serve as a comprehensive learning resource for mastering Spring Boot and related technologies, while also covering essential concepts and practices frequently encountered in real-world projects. By working on this project, you will:

- Gain practical experience in building a full-fledged web application from scratch.
- Learn how to implement user authentication, authorization, and session management.
- Understand the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and layered architecture.
- Explore advanced topics such as multithreading, transaction management, and logging.
- Practice writing unit tests, integration tests, and automated testing using popular frameworks.
- Familiarize yourself with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Acquire hands-on experience in database interactions using both in-memory databases and relational databases like Oracle.

### Why CoreBankX?

CoreBankX is designed with simplicity and comprehensiveness in mind. By focusing on a core banking scenario, we aim to provide a familiar context for developers to apply their skills and explore various features of Spring Boot in a structured manner. Whether you're a Java enthusiast looking to deepen your understanding of Spring Boot or a job seeker preparing for interviews, CoreBankX offers a practical and engaging learning journey.
